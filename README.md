# Cookie Cats A/B Test Project

This project is my **course project from my Statistical Analysis with Python course at university**. The goal is to analyze how moving the first gate from **level 30 to level 40** in the mobile game **Cookie Cats** affects player behavior.

## Project Overview

- **Game:** Cookie Cats, a match-three puzzle game  
- **Focus:** The first gate in the game and its impact on player retention and number of game rounds  
- **Main Questions:**  
  - Does moving the gate change 1-day and 7-day retention?  
  - Does it affect how many rounds players play?

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be downloaded from:

## Analysis

All **statistical analyses are performed entirely in the Jupyter Notebook**, including:  

- Data exploration and visualization  
- Proportion Z Tests for retention  
- Mann-Whitney U Test and t-tests for number of game rounds  
- Variable transformations and parametric vs non-parametric comparisons
